# Foundation of Graphics Methods & Cmake Compatability
Welcome to my repo for CSE386 at Miami University (Foundation of Graphics)


This Repo contains:

+ A cmake file which allows students an alternative option for building the project (Doesn't depend on Visual Studio 2019)
    
+ Most of the exercises I completed that wasn't explicitly stated to be copyrighted material


### Additions to the initial project

Although the entire graphics C++ build couldn't be added here, using the Cmake package allowed me to develop/work on assignments
using a linux environment as opposed to a Mac/Windows machine. Instructions for building the project should follow the typical
requirements for a Cmake project.
